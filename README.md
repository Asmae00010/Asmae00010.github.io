# Portfolio 

### Education 
4th year industrial engineering student at ENSAM MEKNES specialized in AI and data science

### Academic Projects 
#### Customer FeedBack Sentiment Analysis using NLP
Utilizing NLP and SVM techniques to analyze customer feedback to successfully identifying key sentiments and trends to inform business strategy improvements.
#### ChatGiiads : Open Source LLM for industrial applications (ongoing project)
Fine tuning an open source LLM for industrial domain
#### Machine Learning-Driven Predictions for Machining Constraint and Deformation
Utilizing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to estimate machining constraints and deformations. By inputting key parameters such as cutting speed and depth, the model simplifies complex usinage simulations that traditionally take hours to compute.
